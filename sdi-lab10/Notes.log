Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5.

If you were to list
all the whole numbers 
below 10 that are multiples 
of 3 or 5, they would be 3, 5, 6, and 9. 
This is because 3 x 1 = 3, 5 x 1 = 5, 3 x 2 = 6, 
and 3 x 3 = 9. The sum of these multiples 
(3 + 5 + 6 + 9) is 23. Your task is to create a function 
that will find and return the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 
below 1000.

1. Create a function

2. Must find and return the sum of all
the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
